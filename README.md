# Data-Visualization-Of-Bird-Strike-Analysis-2000-2011
Recently dove into the world of aviation safety by completing a Power BI project on bird strike analysis. This project involved analyzing a large dataset (mention the size if possible) to identify patterns and trends in bird strike incidents.

By leveraging the power of Power BI, I was able to:

Visualize key insights: Created compelling visualizations to identify high-risk locations, bird species most involved, and seasonal variations in strikes.
Uncover hidden patterns: Identified previously unknown correlations between factors like weather conditions and bird strike occurrences.
Inform data-driven decisions: My analysis provided valuable insights that can be used to develop targeted bird strike mitigation strategies.
This project was a great opportunity to showcase my data analysis and data visualization skills using Power BI. I'm passionate about using data to improve aviation safety, and this project was a rewarding experience.
